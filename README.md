# Stream2FinalProject
Final project for stream 2

This project makes use of a database downloaded from data.world at the following link https://data.world/harishkgarg/harry-potter-universe
and then edited by myself. It was created using Flask in pycharm, and uses the following;

D3.js- a javascript library for visualising data with HTML, SVG and CSS
Dc.js- a javascript charting library
Crossfilter.js- javascript library that manages the data behind charts, to allow data to be grouped and filtered in the browser
Queue.js- an asynchronous helper library for javascript
MongoDB- a noSQL database used to convert and present data in JSON format

It displays data from Harry Potter using the lessons learned in stream 2 of the code institute course.
